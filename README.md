## Liquid Web Framework
LW was originally a CMS that I made way back in 2000, it's no progressed to a simple framework that I use with most/all of my projects to rapidly develop my web sites with.  Since I do use this for most of my projects, I'm putting it on Git and then composer so that I can post my other projects, and the DB access especially will be readily available.

Since I am putting this on GitHub now, I figure I need to document some of it, and this file will attempt to do so.

### Install
Composer:

    "jlawrence/lw": "dev-master"
